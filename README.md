## Project 
Interactive Music Mixer

## Concept 
A audio-visual game around on basic JavaScript “Drag and Drop” function. 

## Theme  
The Fast and the Furious

Create a UI with draggable pieces. The whole interface is a virtual cockpit from a first-person-perspective. Users will place in the “The Fast and the Furious” world through the revving engine's rumble, exhaust explosion sound and passionate background music.


## Interactive Feature Breakdown:

-    Vector icon animation when drag and drop? (To be add later)
-Volume control will place beside the drop zone. (To be add later)
-Reset function/button (To be add later)


## Page Load: 

- Use virtual cockpit as the interface background
- In Middle part of the interface, we will add a dynamic video of highway driving. Users will have the feeling of actually driving through the front windshield. 
- Vector supercar logo icon will be placed on the page left side as a part of the drag zone.
- Gear model includes “Eco-economic, S-sport, S+ -sport plus and Corsa” will place on the page right side as also a drag zone.  
- Set up the drag and drop functionality, load the initial four logos and four gears of the car on the side.
- Drop zone will place at the middle bottom of the virtual instrument desk. There will be two separate drop zone beside each drop zone, one for the car, one for background music corresponding to the gear model.
